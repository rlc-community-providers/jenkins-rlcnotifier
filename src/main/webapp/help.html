        This plugin allows you to notify Serena Release Control when a job has completed. The plugin assumes that
        the job has been executed directly from Serena Release Control and the a build parameter called RLC_EXECUTION_ID
        has been defined.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get started you should first define one or more Serena RLC servers on the Jenkins global config page.
        Then you can use those servers in your jobs.
